# Introduction to Spacy

This repository contains code examples demonstrating the usage of spaCy, a powerful natural language processing library in Python.

## SpaCy

In this section, we introduce spaCy, which is a Python library used for natural language processing tasks such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and dependency parsing. spaCy is widely acclaimed for its speed, accuracy, and ease of use, making it a preferred choice for many NLP practitioners and researchers.

## Reading from a Text File

Reading text data from a file is a common task in natural language processing projects. In this section, we demonstrate how to read text from a file and process it using spaCy. This allows us to analyze and manipulate larger text datasets stored in files efficiently, facilitating tasks such as text preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training.

## Sentence Detection

Sentence detection is the process of identifying and segmenting individual sentences within a text document. Accurate sentence detection is crucial for many NLP tasks such as text summarization, sentiment analysis, and machine translation. In this section, we showcase how spaCy's built-in sentence detection capabilities automatically identify sentence boundaries, enabling efficient processing of text data at the sentence level.

## Custom Function for Space Detection

In some cases, we may encounter unconventional sentence boundaries, such as ellipsis (...) or specific punctuation patterns. In such scenarios, customizing spaCy's sentence detection mechanism can improve the accuracy of sentence segmentation. In this section, we demonstrate how to implement a custom function for space detection, allowing spaCy to handle non-standard sentence boundaries effectively.

## Tokenization & Its Attributes

Tokenization is the process of splitting text into individual tokens (words, punctuation marks, etc.), which serves as the foundational step in many NLP tasks. In this section, we explore tokenization in spaCy and discuss various token attributes such as whether a token is alphanumeric, a punctuation mark, or a stop-word. Understanding token attributes is essential for tasks such as feature extraction, text classification, and sentiment analysis.

## Stop-Words

Stop-words are common words (e.g., "the", "is", "and") that are often filtered out during text processing as they carry little semantic meaning. In this section, we demonstrate how spaCy's built-in stop-word list can be used to remove stop-words from text data, improving the quality of text analysis and reducing noise in downstream tasks such as topic modeling, keyword extraction, and information retrieval.

## Lemmatization

Lemmatization is the process of reducing words to their base or dictionary form (e.g., "running" → "run", "better" → "good"), which helps in standardizing text data and improving the accuracy of text analysis tasks. In this section, we showcase how spaCy performs lemmatization, enabling tasks such as keyword extraction, topic modeling, and document clustering to operate on normalized text representations.

## Word Frequency

Word frequency analysis involves counting the occurrences of each word in a text document, providing valuable insights into the most common words used in the text corpus. In this section, we use spaCy in combination with Python's Counter from the collections module to calculate word frequency, facilitating tasks such as keyword extraction, topic modeling, and document summarization based on the distribution of words in the text data.

## Parts of Speech Tagging

Parts-of-speech tagging involves assigning grammatical categories (e.g., noun, verb, adjective) to each word in a text document, enabling syntactic analysis and feature extraction. In this section, we demonstrate spaCy's parts-of-speech tagging capabilities, which are fundamental for understanding the syntactic structure of sentences and extracting meaningful information from text for tasks such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and text generation.

## Visualization

Visualization is an important aspect of NLP for gaining insights into text data and model outputs. In this section, we use spaCy's displaCy module to visualize sentence structure, which helps in understanding the relationships between words and their syntactic roles in sentences. Visualizing syntactic dependencies and named entities enhances the interpretability of NLP models and facilitates error analysis and model debugging.

## Preprocessing

Preprocessing is the initial step in many NLP pipelines, involving tasks such as text normalization, stop-word removal, and punctuation removal. In this section, we demonstrate how to preprocess text data using spaCy, which prepares the text for further analysis and modeling. Preprocessing steps such as tokenization, lemmatization, and stop-word removal help in transforming raw text data into a clean and standardized format suitable for NLP tasks such as text classification, information retrieval, and sentiment analysis.

## Rule-Based Matching

Rule-based matching is a technique used to extract information from text based on predefined patterns or rules, enabling tasks such as named entity recognition, information extraction, and semantic parsing. In this section, we showcase spaCy's Matcher, which allows us to define custom rules for matching tokens in text data, facilitating the extraction of structured information from unstructured text data sources such as documents, emails, and social media posts.

## Dependency Parsing Using spaCy

Dependency parsing is the process of analyzing the grammatical structure of sentences by identifying relationships between words, enabling tasks such as syntactic analysis, information extraction, and question answering. In this section, we demonstrate how spaCy performs dependency parsing, which helps in understanding the syntactic dependencies and hierarchical structure of sentences, facilitating tasks such as parsing complex sentences, identifying subject-verb relationships, and extracting noun phrases and verb phrases from text data.

## Tree and Subtree Navigation

Navigating through syntactic trees and subtrees is useful for exploring the hierarchical structure of sentences and extracting relevant information, enabling tasks such as subtree extraction, syntactic analysis, and text summarization. In this section, we showcase how to navigate trees and subtrees in spaCy, facilitating tasks such as extracting syntactic patterns, identifying grammatical relationships, and analyzing sentence structures for linguistic research, information extraction, and text mining applications.

## Shallow Parsing

Shallow parsing, also known as chunking, involves identifying and extracting syntactic phrases such as noun phrases and verb phrases from text, enabling tasks such as semantic analysis, information extraction, and text summarization. In this section, we demonstrate spaCy's capabilities for shallow parsing, which helps in extracting structured information from unstructured text data, facilitating tasks such as identifying key phrases, extracting named entities, and summarizing text content based on syntactic patterns and relationships.

## Named Entity Recognition

Named entity recognition (NER) is the task of identifying and classifying named entities such as persons, organizations, and locations in text, enabling tasks such as information extraction, entity linking, and document classification. In this section, we showcase spaCy's NER capabilities, which are essential for extracting structured information from unstructured text data sources such as news articles, academic papers, and social media posts, facilitating tasks such as entity extraction, relation extraction, and event extraction for various NLP applications.
